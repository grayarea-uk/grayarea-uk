Does your company provide services or hire equipment for events, large, small, indoor, or outdoor?

Over the last 4/5 years, Iâ€™ve developed a very niche affiliation within events and festival industries having a large and growing network of previous and potential prospects spanning festivals, country shows, Halloween farm events, winter wonderlands, sports, food markets and weddings, with 15 years of lead generation, marketing and sales experience both in-house managing the full sales cycle, and as an outsourced lead generator, I provide specialist lead generations services.

Short and longer campaigns, services for your specific needs and goals,. With none of my clients competing directly you can benefit from the added cross-sell opportunities, transparency of my other clients within your industry.

Setup fee depending on complexity of the products & systems.
